## FACE RECOGNITION AND DETECTION SYSTEM
<p>A face recognition and detection system is basically a technology which detects the face a of a person based on provided training datasets. It is a rule based model which predicts output based on historical data provided to the machine . In my project i have used google teachable machine to train my machine. I have used the image model to feed the image datasets of two people. It is restricted to only two people to avoid increasing time and space complexity and making my model more reliable and quick . I have used many libraries which i will be discussing further in the modules section. The code is basically divided into two code frameworks one is to collect data which collects 500 images of the person. This is repeated for the other person also.Then the other code framework is the test.py which is the includes the main code of the project .</p>
