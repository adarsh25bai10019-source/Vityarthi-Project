# Problem Statement
In educational institutions and corporate environments, conventional methods of attendance tracking suffer from significant drawbacks including time inefficiency, proxy fraud, and lack of real-time monitoring. The objective of this project is to design and implement a real-time Face Recognition Attendance System using Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

# Target Users
1. The target users of this face recognition system are educational institutions which have a cumbersome task of manually taking and recording attedance.
2. Human Computer interaction.
3. Passenger screening.
4. Face id used in phones 

# High-level features
1. Face detection
2. Feature extraction
3. Face matching
